//
// Unicode characters translations can be implemented in parallel
// using bit translation sets.   For each bit in the Unicode
// representation of source and target characters, the default bit
// translation set is the set of all codepoints such that the codepoint
// value at the given bit position differs from the target codepoint
// value at the same bit position.  Alternatively in LiteralBit
// mode, the bit translation set is based on the bits of the
// target codepoint only.

// Unicode potentially requires 21 bit translation sets for each
// of the bit positions in Unicode.   However, if the higher
// order bits do not play a role in translation, they may be
// omitted.

//
//  Given a TranslationMap return a vector of bit translations
//  for all bit positions up to the highest that participates
//  in the translation (i.e., the highest bit that differs
//  between the source and target codepoints in at least one

//  Unicode character translation may be performed directly on
//  a UTF-8 basis bit representation, with the possible insertion
//  or deletion of up to 3 positions, i.e., insertion of 3 positions
//  for translations of a single-byte UTF-8 character to a 4-byte
//  UTF-8 sequence or vice versa.
//
//  Compute the UTF-8 insertion bixnum, which for each codepoint
//  cp is either 00, 01, 10, or 11 indicating that the trans[cp]
//  requires insertion of 0, 1, 2, or 3 bytes to the UTF-8 representation.
//  (In the case of 0 inserted bytes, deletion may be required).
//  General translations require a 2-bit bixnum, but a single-bit
//  bixnum may result when no instance of insertion of more than
//  one position is required.    If a translation requires no
//  insertions at all, an empty vector is returned.
