/*   The regular expression compiler works in terms of three fundamental bit stream
     concepts: barrier streams, index streams and marker streams.

     It is often desirable to consider that the input stream is divided
     into separate matching regions, such that any matched string must be
     wholly contained within one region.   For example, in grep-style
     matching, the matching regions are the individual lines of the line,
     and matches do not extend across more than one line.
     A barrier stream is used to separate the input into regions broken by
     positions marked by 1 bits.   Thus a matched substring will always
     correspond to a consecutive run of 0 bits in the barrier stream.

     Index streams mark positions corresponding to whole matching units.
     For example, if the matching units are UTF-8 sequences, then the index
     stream identifies the last byte of each UTF-8 sequence denoting a single
     Unicode codepoint.   If the matching units are UTF-16 sequences then the
     index stream will have one bits on every UTF-16 code unit that denotes
     a full Unicode character itself, as well as on the final code unit of
     a surrogate pair.

     Index streams may be defined with respect to a particular regular expression.
     For example, an index stream with respect to an regular expression involved
     in a bounded repetition may mark the last code unit of substrings matching
     a so-called characteristic subexpression of the bounded repetition.
     As a characteristic subexpression is a subexpression that must be matched
     once and only once for the repetition, the index stream may be used to
     count the number of repetitions.

     If the unit of matching is defined in terms of code units (e.g., UTF-8 bytes
     or UTF-16 double bytes) then the correspoinding index stream is the stream
     of all one bits.

     Marker streams represent the results of matching steps.
     Markers have an offset with respect to compiled regular expressions.
     Offset 0 means that each marker bit is placed at a position corresponding
     to the last code unit of a matched substring.

     Offsets are expressed with respect to an index stream.   An offset N > 0
     means that the marker is placed N positions further along the index stream
     than the last code unit of the matched substring.

     An offset of 1 with an index stream of all ones means that marker stream
     is placed on the code unit immediately after the last code unit matched.  The offset
     1 naturally arises whenever a regular expression can match the empty string.

     Non-zero offsets also arise in matching lookahead assertions.  For example,
     Unicode boundary assertions such as word boundaries or grapheme cluster
     boundaries typically involving lookahead at one or two Unicode characters.
     If the underlying streams are based on UTF-8 code units, then the index
     stream for such an offset is the the stream marking the final bytes of
     UTF-8 code unit sequences.  */
